# Rooster Grin Front-End Exercise

## How to run:

<pre>
  npm install
  npm start
</pre>


## What technologies I used and why

I used Boostrap since it was already installed and imported, also to save time with grid and some of the styles.

Sass to use nesting, variables and mixins.

BEM for class naming to organize html code into reusable blocks

npm install and npm start commands to see changes live while working on the website


## Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

Bootstrap, as I don't really like to use it and forgot some of the naming.
Webpack configurations when trying to deploy the website to github pages.


## What you enjoyed the most and why

Working under pressure and trying to do as much as possible in a short amount of time. 
Working on the website in general since everyting was already set up and I could start right away :)
